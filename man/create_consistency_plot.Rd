\title{Create Consistency Plot}
\usage{
create_consistency_plot(d)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A data.table containing the data to be plotted. It should have columns 'well', 'object_class', 'total_count', 'frame', 'row', and 'col'.}
}
\value{
A heatmap showing the classification consistency across the plate, faceted by object class.
}
\description{
This function generates a heatmap demonstrating the consistency of classification in the bright field across different conditions.
For each well and object class, a linear regression model is fitted to the object count over time.
The slope of this model, normalized by the initial count and expressed as a percentage, represents the rate of change in classification.
The plot is faceted by object class, allowing comparison of classification consistency across different types of objects.
